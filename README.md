# Client-Server-Function-Solver
The task is to create a grid computing server-client architecture where a client is able to perform calculations using specialized computational servers. Each server will be able to perform a single computation as a function of x: f(x). Clients should be able to perform a sequence of computations with the help of these specialized servers. Implement and test both the client and the server against a set of computational sequence inputs provided from a file.
